// Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying if dogs are eating too much or too little.
// Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than the recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.
// Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a range 10% above and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).

// 1. Loop over the array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do NOT create a new array, simply loop over the array. Forumla: recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
// 2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too little. HINT: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose) ðŸ¤“
// 3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much ('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little ('ownersEatTooLittle').
// 4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this: "Matilda and Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat too little!"
// 5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating EXACTLY the amount of food that is recommended (just true or false)
// 6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an OKAY amount of food (just true or false)
// 7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an OKAY amount of food (try to reuse the condition used in 6.)
// 8. Create a shallow copy of the dogs array and sort it by recommended food portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the array's objects)

// HINT 1: Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use the summary lecture to choose between them ðŸ˜‰
// HINT 2: Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion means: current > (recommended * 0.90) && current < (recommended * 1.10). Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the recommended portion.
